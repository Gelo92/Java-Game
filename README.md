# Java-Game
a GUI that implements a game, where the user has to click the button corresponding to an image

 The four buttons show arrows point up, down, left and right respectively.
 When the user presses the “Play” button, an arrow should be shown in the middle, as shown in Figure 2. The
user should click on the corresponding arrow.
 If the user does click on the correct arrow, then their score should be incremented by 1. If the user clicks on
the incorrect arrow, then their score should be reset to 0.
 Once the user has clicked on an arrow, correct or incorrect, a new middle arrow should be randomly chosen
– this is now the arrow the user clicks on.
 If the user clicks on the “Reset” button, the score should be reset to 0 and the central image should be reset
to a blank image.
